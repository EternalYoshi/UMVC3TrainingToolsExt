A tool designed to incrase and improve quality of life of Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3's training mode.
This tool adds more options that weren't present before, like being able to set Frank's level, Mr. Wright's evidence, start positions, etc.

Uses Imgui still.
Thanks to HKHaan, Sheep, Techs, and Ermaccer for their contributions that made this and the original git of this version possible.

Features will be added to the next release when they are confirmed working problem free.
